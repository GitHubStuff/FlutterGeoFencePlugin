# geofence_plugin

A Geofence Flutter plugin.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Worthy Notes

This plugin is based off work found at
[Executing Dart in the Background with Flutter Plugins and Geofencing](https://medium.com/flutter/executing-dart-in-the-background-with-flutter-plugins-and-geofencing-2b3e40a1a124),
written by Ben Kyoni, with [code](https://github.com/bkonyi/FlutterGeofencing)

Updated by me for Swift 5.

## Usage

## Getting Started
This plugin works on both Android and iOS. Follow the instructions in the following sections for the
platforms which are to be targeted.

### Android

Add the following lines to your `AndroidManifest.xml` to register the background service for
geofencing:

```xml
<receiver android:name="io.flutter.plugins.geofencing.GeofencingBroadcastReceiver"
    android:enabled="true" android:exported="true"/>
<service android:name="io.flutter.plugins.geofencing.GeofencingService"
    android:permission="android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE" android:exported="true"/>
```

Also request the correct permissions for geofencing:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

Finally, create either `Application.kt` or `Application.java` in the same directory as `MainActivity`.
 
For `Application.kt`, use the following:

```kotlin
class Application : FlutterApplication(), PluginRegistrantCallback {
  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    GeofencingService.setPluginRegistrant(this);
  }

  override fun registerWith(registry: PluginRegistry) {
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(registry);
  }
}
```

For `Application.java`, use the following:

```java
public class Application extends FlutterApplication implements PluginRegistrantCallback {
  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    GeofencingService.setPluginRegistrant(this);
  }

  @Override
  public void registerWith(PluginRegistry registry) {
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(registry);
  }
}
```

Which must also be referenced in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
    <application
        android:name=".Application"
        ...
```
 
### iOS

Add the following lines to your Info.plist:

```xml
<dict>
    <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
    <string>YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE</string>
    <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
    <string>YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE</string>
    ...
```

And request the correct permissions for geofencing:

```xml
<dict>
    ...
    <string>Main</string>
    <key>UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities</key>
    <array>
        <string>location-services</string>
        <string>gps</string>
        <string>armv7</string>
    </array>
    <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
    <array>
        <string>location</string>
    </array>
    ...
</dict>
```
